# UI Interactions Guide (Lazygit Keymap Parity)

This document tracks ratagit keybindings against the local lazygit repo at `D:\prj\lazygit`
(checked at lazygit commit `d167063b4`).
The operation groups and default keys are aligned with lazygit `docs/keybindings/Keybindings_en.md`
and the default keybinding config in `pkg/config/user_config.go`.

## Legend

- Implemented?: `✅` yes, `❌` no
- Have test?: `✅` yes, `❌` no
- Lazygit key notation: `<c-b>` means Ctrl+B, `<s-down>` means Shift+Down, and `B` means Shift+B.

---

## Lazygit UI operation levels

- Global: actions available across the app unless an overlay/input context captures the key.
- Shared list navigation: list cursor movement, paging, range select, search/filter, tabs, and horizontal scroll.
- Resource panels: status, files, branches, commits, stash, remotes, tags, worktrees, submodules, reflog, sub-commits, and commit files.
- Main panel modes: normal, staging, merging, and custom patch building.
- Overlay/input contexts: menu, confirmation, input prompt, commit summary, and secondary view.

- Status panel operation keys

### Medium-Priority Missing

- Remotes and remote branches
- Worktrees
- Reflog and sub-commits

## Update Protocol

When implementing features:

1. Mark `Implemented?` as `✅` when feature works.
2. Mark `Have test?` as `✅` when test coverage is added.
3. Update `docs/tracking/LAZYGIT_FEATURE_PARITY.md` for feature-level tracking.
4. Commit both docs together.

This document is the source of truth for lazygit keymap parity.
